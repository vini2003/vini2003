Hey there!

I'm VinÃ­cius, an 18 year old software developer down in southern Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·)!

I work with Kotlin and Java, and am currently doing work for TommyInnit. I've been working on this for two years, and enjoy coding both professionaly and recreatively - here's some of the stuff I've worked on so far:

- [Minecraftâ€™s Black Hole Mod Is Very Funny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd4ILT8LDoI), whose repository is [here](https://github.com/vini2003/Black-Hole).
- [Minecraftâ€™s Body Shuffle Mod Is Stupidly Funny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9stFKuPGa8), whose repository is [here](https://github.com/vini2003/Body-Shuffle).
- [Minecraftâ€™s Gas Mod is actually funny...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFZ5EMTcehA), whose repository is [here](https://github.com/vini2003/Harmful-Gas).
- [Minecraft, But The Floor Is Lava...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLSSaUv6DwQ), whose repository is [here](https://github.com/vini2003/Void-Rising).
