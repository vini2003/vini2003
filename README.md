**Hey there!**

I'm Vin√≠cius. I'm a low-level software developer focused on performance and reliability, having a particular interest in graphics programming and game systems!

Ever seen a realistic point and shadow mapping system in Minecraft?

Now you have! I'm currently amployed at a media production company, doing game development. We're using this system for environmental design, car headlights and much more.

I've also made a whole bunch of internal tooling which I can't share, but hey - I love this job!
